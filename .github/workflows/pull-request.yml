name: build pull request

# Builds a pull request, basing the artifact name on the branch name on which it is based, so it can be published
# without breaking things, and enabled to build other pull requests depending on the current one.

# For e.g. if you make a pull request based on a branch feature/foobar on the main branch which is 6.1-SNAPSHOT,
# then it will be built and published as 6.1.foobar-SNAPSHOT
